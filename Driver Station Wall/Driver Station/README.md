# Driver Station

The Driver Station is a 8' wall segment separating the robot drivers from the robots on the field.  
The Driver Station provides a foldable shelf for the operator consol.
It is constructed from 2x4 and 1x2 lumber, as well as plywood of varying thickness.  
The steel mesh is a safety item, providing visibility for the robot operators, while protecting them from robots that may hit the wall, or from errant game pieces.
