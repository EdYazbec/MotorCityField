# Wall Brace

The Wall Brace provide structural re-enforcement between sections of the driver station wall.  
These also allow the Driver Station Walls to stand upright.  
The Wall Braces have a hing, allowing them to store easily.
It is recommended to place sand bags or similar ballast on the braces at the ground to provide additional stability.
