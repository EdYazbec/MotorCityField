# Perimeter Brace

The Perimeter Brace adds additional rigidity to the Perimeter wall where two Wall Segments or a Wall Segment and a Gate Segment meet.  
The Perimeter Brace is constructed from 2x4 lumber, and 3/4" plywood.  
The 2x4 lengths can be sourced from off cuts of other 2x4's from this build.
