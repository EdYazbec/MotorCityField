# MotorCityField

This repository contains the source files for the Motor City Field, a full-sized FRC practice field constructed from commonly available building materials.

This field design is based on the AndyMark 2008 Wooden Field, with modifications for ease of assembly and repeated tear-down and setup.

The goal of this design is to create an adaptable, easy-to-manufacture, and reasonably close-to-life field for use by FRC teams.

The Motor City Field was designed, built, and run by the Motor City Alliance, led by FRC Team 5577, The Kinematic Wolves.

## Limitations

Because the official FRC field changes every year, only the evergreen field elements are included in this design. These elements must be adapted with season-specific team field elements to produce a representative field for the current game.

This field is not fully enclosed by default, although it could be adapted to do so. It is intended to be combined with the season-specific team field elements to create a full, enclosed, representative field.

## Safety

FRC robots can be dangerous, especially in a testing environment. This field is designed to be robust; however, a modern FRC robot at full speed and power may exceed the safety provisions of this field.

It is the responsibility of those implementing this design to establish appropriate safety protocols to ensure the safe operation of robots on this field.

## Perimeter

The perimeter segments are designed to match the length of the standard segments used in the evergreen portion of the official field. This allows for easy reconfiguration each season and simpler integration with the season-specific team elements.

## Driver Stations

The driver station walls are designed to match the dimensions of the official field as closely as possible. These walls require additional bracing compared to the perimeter walls. Typically, the season-specific field has additional elements that connect to or insert into the driver station walls. It is up to the end user to finalize the details for each season.

## Drawing Package

The included drawing package contains engineering drawings for the evergreen portion of the Motor City Field, as well as integration with some 2025 team field elements. This package may be updated in the future.  

## Notes

- This repository focuses on the evergreen field elements; users will need to adapt or add season-specific elements each year.
